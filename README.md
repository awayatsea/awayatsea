- Hi there, I'm @awayatsea. I have just started to learn programming, and I have started out with python.
- I'm still a complete beginner, but I wanted to be early out here, just to familiarize myself with the service, and start building a portfolio early on.
- I think that I have a lot of potential for the future within the software industry.
- I'm self tought, and at the moment what I do for a living is being a navigational officer on a platform supply vessel (PSV)
- You can always get a hold on me via e-mail: andawayatsea@gmail.com
